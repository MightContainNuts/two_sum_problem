Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
Constraints:
Assume that each input will have exactly one solution.
You may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Examples
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
Input: nums = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4], target = 7
Output: : [1, 3] (since 5 + 2 = 7)
